                        The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. The story began
                        as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger
                        work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels
                        ever written, with over 150 million copies sold,
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The title of the novel refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron,[a] who had in an earlier age created
                        the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and
                        rule all of Middle-earth. From quiet beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land not unlike the English
                        countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the course of the War of the Ring through
                        the eyes of its characters, most notably the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin.

                The enduring popularity of The Lord of the Rings has led to numerous references in popular culture, the founding of many
                societies by fans of Tolkien's works,[11] and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works.
                The Lord of the Rings has inspired, and continues to inspire, artwork, music, films and television, video
                games, board games, and subsequent literature. Award-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings have been
                made for radio, theatre, and film
